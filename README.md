# 💼 Financial Reporting Dashboard – Power BI Internship Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard was developed as part of my internship project during my undergraduate program at **VLB Janakiammal College of Arts and Science**. The goal was to deliver actionable insights through interactive dashboards that visualize financial data such as sales, profits, and unit performance across segments, products, and countries.

## 🎯 Objective

To provide a clear and comprehensive analysis of financial performance by tracking key metrics such as:

- ✅ Total Sales  
- ✅ Total Profit  
- ✅ Units Sold  
- ✅ Profit Margin  

The dashboard highlights trends, product and segment contributions, and country-level profitability, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

1. Removed duplicate sales records  
2. Replaced special characters (like $, commas)  
3. Converted date fields using locale settings  
4. Handled null values in key columns  
5. Corrected data types for numeric fields  
6. Renamed columns for clarity

## 📐 Key Calculations

- `Profit Margin (%)` = Profit / Sales * 100  
- `Discount (%)` = Discounts / Gross Sales * 100
